## Training
### FAIR in (biological) practice – Ed-DaSH
The course has material on FAIR principles as well as RDM best practice. The great thing about this material is that it can be taught face-to-face as part of <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a> or be delivered online/on-demand.
You do not need to have prior knowledge of data management to benefit from this course, but familiarity with spreadsheets (such as Excel) and a bio background will be helpful.
This is aimed at researchers who are working in the life sciences, and those who wish to have a better understanding of Open Science and FAIR practices.

### How to FAIR
This online web resource is a fantastic option for those involved with data management across any discipline, it is also a great starting point for novices. Within a few hours, those taking the course will learn the FAIR principles, how to work in line with them and how to improve research data management. It is possible to do this learning in sections, it is not required to complete all the stages together making it even easier for those who need to slot it into busy lives.

### GoFAIR – FAIR Principles
For those wanting to learn about FAIR principles with real data examples, the GoFAIR content is a great starting point. This content takes each letter of FAIR and breaks down those into their individual principles (for example, F has four sub-categories) with explanations of what they mean, why they are important and then real life examples to help connect that learning to actual data work.
This is a fantastic resource for anyone working in the life sciences, especially those who wish to link their learning with examples.

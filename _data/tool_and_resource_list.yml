    DIP, HPRD, IntAct, MINT) and from experimentally resolved 3D structures (PDB)
    where more than two distinct proteins have been identified. APID also includes
    a data visualization web-tool that allows the construction of sub-interactomes
    using query lists of proteins of interest and the visual exploration of the corresponding
    networks, including an interactive selection of the properties of the interactions
    reliability of the "edges") and a mapping of the functional environment of the
    proteins (functional annotations of the "nodes").'

- description: 'The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) Version 3.


    The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is a community-developed data standard
    that allows knowledge about biological designs to be captured using a machine-tractable,
    ontology-backed representation that is built using Semantic Web technologies.
    While early versions of SBOL focused only on the description of DNA-based components
    and their sub-components, SBOL can now be used to represent knowledge across multiple
    scales and throughout the entire synthetic biology workflow, from the specification
    of a single molecule or DNA fragment through to multicellular systems containing
    multiple interacting genetic circuits. The third major iteration of the SBOL standard,
    SBOL3, is an effort to streamline and simplify the underlying data model with
    a focus on real-world applications, based on experience from the deployment of
    SBOL in a variety of scientific and industrial settings'

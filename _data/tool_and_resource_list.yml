- description: Created in 2008 by the CGIAR, the Crop Ontology (CO; http://www.cropontology.org)
    is an essential source of traits and variables to support the standardization
    of the breeding databases such as the Integrated Breeding Platform's BMS (IBP;
    https://www.integratedbreeding.net/) and the Boyce Thompson Institute's Breedbase
    (https://breedbase.org/) (Arnaud et al., 2020). By providing descriptions of agronomic,
    morphological, physiological, quality, and stress traits along with their definitions
    and relationships, also including a standard nomenclature for composing the variables,
    the CO enables digital capture and aggregation of crop trait data, as well as
    comparison across projects and locations (Shrestha et al, 2012). The crop ontologies
    follow a conceptual model that defines a phenotypic variable as a combination
    of a trait, a method and a scale. This model aims at supporting the creation and
    management of breeders' field books and the generation of annotated trial data.
    Annotated data are interpretable, interoperable and reusable. The development
    of a crop-specific ontology is a community-driven effort which is usually coordinated
    by a curator (or curators) nominated from within the community itself. CO's Traits
    that are properly described following the guidelines are progressively mapped
    to the Planteome species-neutral Trait Ontology (TO) maintained by Oregon State
    University.

    resource for nucleotide sequence, spanning raw data, alignments and assemblies,
    functional and taxonomic annotation and rich contextual data relating to sequenced
    samples and experimental design. Serving both as the database of record for the
    output of the world's sequencing activity and as a platform for the management,
    sharing and publication of sequence data, the ENA provides a portfolio of services
    for submission, data management, search and retrieval across web and programmatic
    interfaces. The ENA is part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database
    Collaboration (INSDC), which comprises the DNA DataBank of Japan (DDBJ), the European
    Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), and GenBank at the NCBI. These three organizations
    exchange data on a daily basis.

    academic infrastructure should be interchangeable; academic researchers should

    While early versions of SBOL focused only on the description of DNA-based components
    and their sub-components, SBOL can now be used to represent knowledge across multiple
    scales and throughout the entire synthetic biology workflow, from the specification
    of a single molecule or DNA fragment through to multicellular systems containing
    multiple interacting genetic circuits. The third major iteration of the SBOL standard,
    SBOL3, is an effort to streamline and simplify the underlying data model with
    a focus on real-world applications, based on experience from the deployment of
    SBOL in a variety of scientific and industrial settings'

- description: 'UniChem is a very simple, large-scale non-redundant database of pointers
    between chemical structures and EMBL-EBI chemistry resources. Primarily, this
    service has been designed to maintain cross references between EBI chemistry resources.
    These include primary chemistry resources (ChEMBL and ChEBI), and other resources
    where the main focus is not small molecules, but which may nevertheless contain
    some small molecule information (eg: Gene Expression Atlas, PDBe).'

- description: 'The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) is the central hub for the collection
    of functional information on proteins, with accurate, consistent and rich annotation.
    In addition to capturing the core data mandatory for each UniProtKB entry (mainly,
    the amino acid sequence, protein name or description, taxonomic data and citation
    information), as much annotation information as possible is added. This includes
    widely accepted biological ontologies, classifications and cross-references, and
    clear indications of the quality of annotation in the form of evidence attribution
    of experimental and computational data. The UniProt Knowledgebase consists of
    two sections: a reviewed section containing manually-annotated records with information
    extracted from literature and curator-evaluated computational analysis (aka "UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot"),
    and an unreviewed section with computationally analyzed records that await full
    manual annotation (aka "UniProtKB/TrEMBL").'

- description: Zenodo is a generalist research data repository built and developed
    by OpenAIRE and CERN. It was developed to aid Open Science and is built on open
    source code. Zenodo helps researchers receive credit by making the research results
    citable and through OpenAIRE integrates them into existing reporting lines to
    funding agencies like the European Commission. Citation information is also passed
    to DataCite and onto the scholarly aggregators. Content is available publicly
    under any one of 400 open licences (from opendefinition.org and spdx.org). Restricted
    and Closed content is also supported. Free for researchers below 50 GB/dataset.
    Content is both online on disk and offline on tape as part of a long-term preservation
    policy. Zenodo supports managed access (with an access request workflow) as well
    as embargoing generally and during peer review. The base infrastructure of Zenodo
    is provided by CERN, a non-profit IGO. Projects are funded through grants.
